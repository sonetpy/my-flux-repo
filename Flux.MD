Here's a simple trick to remember the relationship between the two Kustomization types:

**"Flux controls what to customize, Kustomize controls how to customize"**

Or think of them as:

1. **Flux's Kustomization** (`kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io`) - The *"Delivery Truck"*
   - Determines *where* to get the manifests (Git repo, bucket)
   - Determines *what* to customize (path to kustomization.yaml)
   - Handles deployment (sync interval, health checks)

2. **Kustomize's Kustomization** (`kustomize.config.k8s.io`) - The *"Workshop"*
   - The actual `kustomization.yaml` file
   - Defines *how* to customize (patches, resources, images)
   - Standard Kustomize configuration

**Memory Aid**: 
- Flux's type has `toolkit` in it (think "toolkit for delivery")
- Kustomize's type has `config` in it (think "configuration for customization")

They work together like:
```
Flux Kustomization (delivery) ‚Üí Finds ‚Üí Kustomize Kustomization (configuration) ‚Üí Generates ‚Üí Final Manifests
```


I understand your confusion! Let me clarify with simple examples of **when to use which Kustomization** and why:

---

### 1. **`kustomization.yaml` (`kustomize.config.k8s.io`)**
**When to use**: When you need to customize Kubernetes manifests (e.g., patch resources, set common labels, override images).  
**Where it lives**: Inside your Git repo as a file named `kustomization.yaml`.  

#### Example:
```yaml
# ./app/deployment/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
patches:
  - patch.yaml  # Modifies replica count or image
```

---

### 2. **Flux Kustomization (`kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io`)**
**When to use**: When you want Flux to **deploy** a Kustomize-managed app from a Git repo/S3 bucket.  
**Where it lives**: Applied to your cluster as a Custom Resource (CR).  

#### Example:
```yaml
# Tells Flux to deploy the app from Git using Kustomize
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 5m  # Sync every 5 minutes
  path: "./app/deployment"  # Path to kustomization.yaml in Git
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository  # Where to fetch manifests
    name: my-repo
```

---

### Key Differences:
| Feature | Kustomize (`kustomize.config.k8s.io`) | Flux (`kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io`) |
|---------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Customize manifests (e.g., patches, vars) | Deploy Kustomize-managed apps |
| **Format** | File named `kustomization.yaml` | Kubernetes CR (applied via `kubectl`) |
| **Location** | Inside Git repo | Applied to the cluster |
| **Trigger** | Manual (`kubectl apply -k`) | Automated (GitOps) |

---

### Real-World Workflow:
1. You write a `kustomization.yaml` (Kustomize) to customize manifests.  
2. You create a Flux `Kustomization` CR to tell Flux:  
   - *"Watch this Git repo, and deploy everything under `./app/deployment` using Kustomize."*  

This separation keeps **configuration** (Kustomize) and **deployment** (Flux) cleanly decoupled.

Here‚Äôs a clear **diagram** and **relationship breakdown** to visualize how the two Kustomization types work together:

### **Step-by-Step Relationship**
1. **Kustomize‚Äôs `kustomization.yaml`**  
   - **Location**: Inside your Git repo (e.g., `/app/kustomization.yaml`).  
   - **Role**: Defines *how* to customize manifests (e.g., patches, common labels).  
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     # ./app/kustomization.yaml
     apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
     kind: Kustomization
     resources:
       - deployment.yaml
     patches:
       - patch.yaml  # Modifies image tag
     ```

2. **Flux‚Äôs `Kustomization` CR**  
   - **Location**: Applied to your cluster (e.g., via `kubectl`).  
   - **Role**: Tells Flux *where* to find the `kustomization.yaml` and *when* to deploy it.  
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
     kind: Kustomization
     metadata:
       name: my-app
     spec:
       interval: 5m  # Sync every 5 minutes
       path: "./app"  # Path to Kustomize's kustomization.yaml
       sourceRef:
         kind: GitRepository
         name: my-repo
     ```

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Flux Kustomization** = **Deployment Driver**  
  - *"Monitor this Git path and deploy it using Kustomize every 5 minutes."*  
- **Kustomize Kustomization** = **Manifest Customizer**  
  - *"Here‚Äôs how to modify the raw YAMLs before deploying."*  

---

### **Analogy**
Think of Flux as a **construction foreman** and Kustomize as the **blueprint**:  
1. The foreman (Flux) knows *where* to get the blueprint (`path: ./app`) and *when* to build (`interval: 5m`).  
2. The blueprint (Kustomize) defines *how* to assemble the building (e.g., "use 3 replicas, set this image tag").  

---

### **When to Use Which?**
| Scenario                          | Which Kustomization?                          |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Patching a Kubernetes Deployment  | `kustomize.config.k8s.io` (in Git)            |
| Automating deployments with GitOps | `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io` (in Cluster)    |
| Overriding image tags             | `kustomize.config.k8s.io` (Kustomize patches) |
| Syncing apps every 10 minutes     | `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io` (Flux CR)       |
