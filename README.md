The error occurs because your local `main` branch and the remote `main` branch have diverged, meaning both have commits that the other doesn't have. Git needs you to specify how to reconcile these differences. You have three main options: **merge**, **rebase**, or **fast-forward only**. Here's how to proceed:

### Step-by-Step Resolution

1. **Choose a reconciliation strategy**:
   - **Merge** (recommended for collaboration or if you're unsure): This creates a merge commit to combine the changes from both branches.
   - **Rebase**: This rewrites your local commits to apply them on top of the remote changes, creating a cleaner, linear history.
   - **Fast-forward only**: This only works if your local branch can be fast-forwarded to the remote branch (no divergent changes), but since your branches have diverged, this won't apply here.

   For most cases, especially if you're working in a team or want to preserve the history of both branches, a **merge** is safer.

2. **Perform the pull with a merge**:
   Run the following to pull and merge the remote changes into your local branch:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main --no-rebase
   ```

   This explicitly tells Git to merge the changes. Alternatively, you can set the default behavior for pulls to always merge:

   ```bash
   git config pull.rebase false
   git pull origin main
   ```

   If you prefer to set this globally for all repositories:

   ```bash
   git config --global pull.rebase false
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Handle merge conflicts (if any)**:
   If the merge results in conflicts, Git will pause and mark the conflicting files. To resolve:
   - Open the conflicting files and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
   - Edit the files to keep the desired changes.
   - Mark the conflicts as resolved:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Complete the merge:
     ```bash
     git commit
     ```

4. **Push the updated branch**:
   After the merge is complete, push your changes to the remote:

   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin main
   ```

5. **Alternative: Rebase (if preferred)**:
   If you want a linear history, you can rebase instead:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main --rebase
   ```

   Or set rebase as the default:

   ```bash
   git config pull.rebase true
   git pull origin main
   ```

   If conflicts arise during rebase, resolve them similarly by editing the files, then continue the rebase with:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

   After rebasing, push your changes (you may need to force push if the history was rewritten):

   ```bash
   git push --force --set-upstream origin main
   ```

   **Note**: Be cautious with force pushing in shared repositories, as it can overwrite others' work.

### Recommended Action
Since your branches have diverged and you likely want to preserve both sets of changes, start with a merge:

```bash
git pull origin main --no-rebase
```

Resolve any conflicts if they occur, then push:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

If you prefer a specific default behavior (merge or rebase) for future pulls, set it with:

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false  # for merge
```

or

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase true  # for rebase
```

If you encounter conflicts or need help with specific files during the merge/rebase, let me know, and I can guide you through resolving them!
